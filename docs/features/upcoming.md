# Product Roadmap

Our vision is to build the most performant and cost-effective observability platform that scales from startup to enterprise. We're committed to delivering lightning-fast analytics across logs, metrics, traces, RUM, error tracking, and session replay while keeping your storage costs 140x lower than traditional solutions.

Every feature we develop is driven by real user needs and our commitment to making observability simple, powerful, and accessible to teams everywhere.
