This guide provides an overview of downsampling, including its configuration, rule format, and an example. 

## Overview

> **Downsampling is an enterprise feature in OpenObserve. It applies only to metrics data.**

Downsampling summarizes historical data into fewer data points. Each summarized data point is calculated using an aggregation method, such as the last recorded value, the average, or the total, applied over a defined time block. 

## Configure Downsampling

Downsampling is configured using the following environment variables.:

- `O2_COMPACT_DOWNSAMPLING_INTERVAL`: Defines how often the downsampling job runs (interval), in seconds. <br>**Example:** `O2_COMPACT_DOWNSAMPLING_INTERVAL`: "300" (this downsampling job runs every 5 minutes)  
- `O2_METRICS_DOWNSAMPLING_RULES`: Specifies which data streams to target and how they should be downsampled using defined rules. You can add a comma-separated list of rules.<br>**Example:** `O2_METRICS_DOWNSAMPLING_RULES`: "o2_cpu_usage:avg:30d:5m", â€œapp_analytics:last:10d:10m"

> Refer to the [Downsampling Rule](#downsampling-rule) section. 

#### Downsampling Configuration For Helm Chart Users

Add the environment variables under the `enterprise.parameters` section in your `values.yaml` file:  
```  
enterprise:  
  enabled: true  
  parameters:  
    `O2_COMPACT_DOWNSAMPLING_INTERVAL`: "60"    
    `O2_METRICS_DOWNSAMPLING_RULES`: "o2_cpu_usage:avg:30d:5m"    
```

#### Downsampling Configuration For Terraform Users

Set the same variables in your `terraform.tfvars` file:  
```  
`O2_COMPACT_DOWNSAMPLING_INTERVAL` = "60"  
`O2_METRICS_DOWNSAMPLING_RULES`    = "up:avg:30d:5m"  
```

### Downsampling Rule

User-defined rules determine how downsampling is applied to metrics streams. You can define multiple downsampling rules to target different streams or use different configurations. 

Each rule must follow the format: `pattern:function:offset:step`.  

Here:

- **pattern**: It is a regular expression that specifies the data streams the rule applies to. For example, `o2_.*`.  
- **function**: The aggregation function used to summarize values. For example, avg, sum, last, count, etc.  
- **offset**: It defines the age of data eligible for downsampling. For example, 15d for applying downsampling on data older than 15 days.  
- **step**: The time block used to group data points. For example, 30m for applying downsampling to retain one value every 30 minutes.

### Downsampling Example

#### Scenario

A system is recording CPU usage data every 10 seconds to the stream `o2_cpu_usage`, generating a large volume of high-resolution metrics. Over time, this data becomes too granular and expensive to store or query efficiently for historical analysis.

#### Goal

Downsample data older than 30 days to retain one average for every 2-minute time block. Run the downsampling job every 3 minutes.

#### Configuration

`O2_COMPACT_DOWNSAMPLING_INTERVAL` = "180"     
`O2_METRICS_DOWNSAMPLING_RULES` = "o2_cpu_usage:avg:30d:2m"
