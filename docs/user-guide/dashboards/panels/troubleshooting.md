## Error: When the query duration is modified due to the query range is restricted   
![When the query duration is modified due to the query range is restricted](../../../images/troubleshooting-panels-error-message.png)

### Resolution   
1. Go to the **Streams** page.  
2. Find the stream you are working with and select **Stream Details** under the **Actions** column.<br>

3. In the stream settings, update the **Max Query Range (in hours)** to a value that supports your query duration. <br>  

## Warning: The data shown is cached and is different from the selected time range 

![The data shown is cached and is different from the selected time range](../../../images/troubleshooting-warning.png)

### Cause
This warning appears when the selected time range has changed, but the panel did not automatically refresh.  

### Resolution   
Click the **Refresh** button in the panel toolbar (the circular arrow icon) to reload the panel with data that matches the current time range.

## Warning: Limiting the displayed series to ensure optimal performance

![Limiting the displayed series to ensure optimal performance](../../../images/troubleshooting-warning-limit-displayed-series.png) 

### Cause
When the `ZO_MAX_DASHBOARD_SERIES` variable is set, the panel will display only the specified number of series. A warning message will appear on the panel indicating that the displayed data has been limited for optimal performance.

!!! Note
    - If a panel includes multiple Y-axes, the limit will apply **individually per Y-axis**.  
    - The **Compare Against** feature will not count toward the series limit. However, if enabled, it may not fully display its comparison results due to this cap. The exact behavior is subject to confirmation.

### Resolution:   

Update the following environment variable:   
```  
ZO_MAX_DASHBOARD_SERIES=<number_of_series>  
```  
Replace <number_of_series> with the maximum number of time series you want each panel to display.

**Example**  <br>
If you set ZO_MAX_DASHBOARD_SERIES=50:

- A panel with a single Y-axis will display up to 50 series.  
- A panel with two Y-axes will display up to 50 series on each axis.
